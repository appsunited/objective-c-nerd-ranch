# Source Codes

All codes and solved exercises of "Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide".
I am working with the [german](http://www.amazon.de/Objective-C-Einstieg-Ranch-Guide-Software-ebook/dp/B00818IZW8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375954660&sr=8-2&keywords=objective+c) edition, but the [english](http://www.amazon.com/Objective-C-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321706285/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375955040&sr=8-2&keywords=objective+c) edition should have the same structure.

### Structure

The first number of directory titles is just for sorting, the second number stands for the chapter. For example: `13-6.4-MathSin` is found in `chapter 6.4` with file name `MathSin`.
